1. Write SQL command to get a substring 'Afternoon' from 'Good Afternoon' and find the length of the final substring. All should be covered in a single SQL command.

SELECT SUBSTRING('Good Afternoon', 6, 9) AS SubStr,
       LEN(SUBSTRING('Good Afternoon', 6, 9)) AS SubStrLength;

2. Write a SQL command to print future date 7days from today. Also print the day (monday or tuesday like that) of that date.

SELECT GETDATE() AS Today,
       DATEADD(DAY, 7, GETDATE()) AS FutureDate,
       DATENAME(WEEKDAY, DATEADD(DAY, 7, GETDATE())) AS DayName;
